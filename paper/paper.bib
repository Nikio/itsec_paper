  abstract = {Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) could be described as the pervasive
	and global network which aids and provides a system for the monitoring
	and control of the physical world through the collection, processing
	and analysis of generated data by IoT sensor devices. It is projected
	that by 2020 the number of connected devices is estimated to grow
	exponentially to 50 billion. The main drivers for this growth are
	our everyday devices such as cars, refrigerators, fans, lights, mobile
	phones and other operational technologies including the manufacturing
	infrastructures which are now becoming connected systems across the
	world. It is apparent that security will pose a fundamental enabling
	factor for the successful deployment and use of most IoT applications
	and in particular secure routing among IoT sensor nodes thus, mechanisms
	need to be designed to provide secure routing communications for
	devices enabled by the IoT technology. This survey analyzes existing
	routing protocols and mechanisms to secure routing communications
	in IoT, as well as the open research issues. We further analyze how
	existing approaches ensure secure routing in IoT, their weaknesses,
	threats to secure routing in IoT and the open challenges and strategies
	for future research work for a better secure IoT routing. },
